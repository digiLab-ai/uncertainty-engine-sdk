These examples cover some of the core functionality of the Uncertainty Engine Python SDK. Before trying any of them make sure to install the SDK with the `vis` and `notebook` extras if you haven't done so already:
```
pip install "uncertainty_engine[vis, notebook]"
```
or if installing from source:
```
poetry install --extras "vis notebook"
```
