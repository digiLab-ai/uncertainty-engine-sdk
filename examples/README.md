These examples cover some of the core functionality of the Uncertainty Engine Python SDK. Before trying any of them make sure to install the SDK with the `vis` and `notebook` extras if you haven't done so already:

```
pip install "uncertainty_engine[vis, notebook, data]"
```

or if installing from source:

```
poetry install --extras "vis notebook data  "
```
